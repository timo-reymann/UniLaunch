## AI-Generated Contributions Policy

I accept AI-generated contributions to my projects, but with the following important conditions:

1. **Understanding Requirement**: The human user authoring the change must have a clear conceptual understanding of what the code does and how it works.

2. **Ownership Awareness**: The human contributor must understand that they own the intellectual property rights to the result, not the AI agent or tool that assisted them.

3. **Explicit Attribution**: The human contributor must clearly state their understanding and compliance with the above conditions through one of these methods:
   - Using "Co-Authored-By" attribution in the commit message
   - Explicitly mentioning in the GitHub pull request description that AI assistance was used and that they understand and take responsibility for the changes

4. **Right to Decline**: If these conditions are not clearly met in the contribution, I reserve the right to decline the pull request without further explanation.

5. **Quality Standards**: All contributions, whether AI-assisted or not, must meet the same quality standards and will be evaluated on their technical merit.

By contributing to this project, you agree to these terms and acknowledge that you are responsible for the code you submit, regardless of how it was generated.
